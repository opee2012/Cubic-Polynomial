# CSCI 208, Project 2, Fall 2021

Compete the program provided that builds and evaluates a cubic polynomial.  Your program must
* Allow the user to input the values of all four coefficients
* Print a well-formatted version of the polynomial 
* Print a table of *x* and *f(x)* values as *x* ranges from -2.0 to 2.0

Cubic Polynomails look like this:
f(x) = a<sub>3</sub>x<sup>3</sup> + a<sub>2</sub>x<sup>2</sup> + a<sub>1</sub>x + a<sub>0</sub>


## How and What to Submit
Submission will happen via this GitHub respository.  So you'll need to make sure you *add* all necessary files , and you will also need to make sure your code is committed and pushed to GitHub *before* the submission due date.  There's no need to do anything in BlackBoard other than accept the initial invitation link.

Here are the files that should be present in your repository:
* Any necessary C++ source files
* A *Makefile* that builds your program
* At least two different example input files
* Any special instructions for running your program (if needed).

## Hint For Testing
[Wolframe Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) is your friend.
